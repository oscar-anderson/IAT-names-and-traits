# Is Owen More Agreeable than Victor? Implicit Associations Between ‘Rounded’ or ‘Spikey’ Names and Perceptions of Personality. (Anderson & Angele, 2021)

This repository contains the full report for my undergraduate dissertation project, completed as part of my Bachelor of Science (BSc) Psychology degree. The study explores the cross-modal associations between phonemes and personality traits, with a focus on the Bouba-Kiki effect and its potential implications for social perception.

## Summary

The research employed a within-subjects and within-items design, comparing response times and accuracy in categorising adjectives and names under congruent and incongruent conditions, within the Implicit Association Test (IAT). A sample of 24 participants took part in the study, categorising stimuli based on rounded-sounding (sonorant phonemes) and sharp-sounding (voiceless-stop phonemes) names, along with agreeable and disagreeable traits.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to extend gratitude to those who have been instrumental in supporting me to undertake this piece of research.

Thank you to my supervisor, Dr Bernhard Angele, whose patience, insight and exceptional breadth of knowledge served to drive me through this project and will continue to inspire me throughout the rest of my academic pursuits.

Thank you to my parents, Chris and Emma Anderson, for being such loving cheerleaders and supporting every path that I took throughout my university career.

And thank you to the 2019 coronavirus pandemic. Without you, I’d have completed the initial project that I had spent months preparing, I’d have already graduated with my degree, and I’d probably have been on a holiday or two by now.
