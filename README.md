# Is Owen more agreeable than Victor? Implicit associations between ‘rounded’ or ‘spikey’ names and perceptions of personality. (BSc dissertation)

This repository contains the complete report for my Bachelor of Science (BSc) dissertation project. The study explores the cross-modal associations between phonemes and personality traits, with a focus on the Bouba-Kiki effect and its potential implications for social perception.

## Summary

The research employed a within-subjects and within-items design, comparing response times and accuracy in categorising adjectives and names under congruent and incongruent conditions, within the Implicit Association Test (IAT). A sample of 24 participants took part in the study, categorising stimuli based on rounded-sounding (sonorant phonemes) and sharp-sounding (voiceless-stop phonemes) names, along with agreeable and disagreeable traits.
