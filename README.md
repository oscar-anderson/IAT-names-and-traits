# Is Owen more agreeable than Victor? Implicit associations between ‘rounded’ or ‘spikey’ names and perceptions of personality.

## Abstract
Perception research has shown that individuals tend to associate sounds and stimuli of other sensory modalities in similar ways (Köhler, 1929; Ramachandran & Hubbard, 2001). Recent investigations interested in this phenomenon have explored whether similar associations exist between sounds and more abstract concepts. So far, significant links have been identified between certain phonemes and characteristics such as gender (Sidhu & Pexman, 2015) and personality (Sidhu et al., 2019), though the scope of relevant literature remains narrow. The current study aimed to further this understanding through use of the Implicit Association Test (Greenwald et al., 1998) and established results consistent with the previous literature – indicating links between smooth-sounding names and agreeableness, and sharp-sounding names and disagreeableness.

## Introduction
Cross-modal association refers to the process by which individuals hold mental links between stimuli of distinct sensory modalities. This process has been observed to occur ubiquitously and in similar ways across many individuals. For example, associations have been reported between smells and colours, with participants consistently linking darker colours to stronger odours (Gilbert, Martin & Kemp, 1996; Kemp & Gilbert, 1997), as well as between colours and tastes of sweetness (Strugnell, 1997), tastes and textures (Alley & Alley, 1998), and visuals and tactile sensations (Morgan, Goodson & Jones, 1975; Martino & Marks, 2000; Simner & Ludwig, 2013). Most notably, however, are the findings of Köhler’s (1929; 1947) early investigations into cross-modal associations between sounds and shapes. In this research, participants were presented with two geometric shapes (one rounded and the other made up of sharp angles) and asked to assign names to each of the stimuli, from a choice of two pseudowords. Köhler discovered that participants tended to consistently and confidently associate the same sounds with the same visual stimuli. Specifically, the pseudoword ‘Takete’ was commonly used to name the spikey shape, while the name ‘Baluma’ (or ‘Maluma’, in later studies) was allocated to the curved alternative. A more recent paper from Ramachandran and Hubbard (2001) has since replicated these findings, reporting that 95% of participants show the same pattern of allocation – assigning the name ‘Kiki’ to a shape of sharp angles and the name ‘Bouba’ to a shape of rounded curves. Clearly, there are similarities in the ways individuals perceive such stimuli – leading to these consistent pairings between items of distinct sensory modalities which may have otherwise been assumed as unrelated. With regards to an explanation for how this phenomenon, colloquially termed the ‘Maluma-Takete’ or ‘Bouba-Kiki’ effect, occurs, Ramachandran and Hubbard concluded that it is the sharpness of the phonemic inflections involved in the pronunciation of a word that determines its association with visual stimuli. The phonemic sharpness of the words ‘Takete’ or ‘Kiki’ link them with a spikey stimulus, while the smoother sounds of the words ‘Baluma’, ‘Maluma’ or ‘Bouba’ relate them more closely with a rounded figure.

However, while these findings are important, the research is not without criticism. As pointed out by Styles and Gawne (2017), Ramachandran and Hubbard’s article omits several important details – including the number of participants that were recruited for experimentation, as well as other fundamental details relating to their methodology – making it difficult to rely upon the credibility of their experimentation and consequent theorising of perceptual processes. The results established by this research, however, are still strongly supported by an abundance of similar literature sharing this empirical focus and conclusion. Research as early as Sapir’s (1929) landmark study found participants to consistently and independently assign the provided name ‘mil’ to an object of smaller size and the name ‘mal’ to an object of larger size. More recent studies also replicate this finding. Maurer, Pathman and Mondloch (2006), and Nielsen and Rendall (2013), for example, showed that voiced bilabial consonants (i.e. /b/ and /m/) and certain other voiced consonants (e.g. /l/ and /n/) tend to be associated with rounded shapes, while voiceless-stop consonants (e.g. /k/, /p/ and /t/) tend to be associated with sharp shapes. Likewise, rounded vowels (e.g. /u/ and /o/) tend to be associated with rounded shapes, while unrounded vowels (e.g. /i/ and /ʌ/) tend to be associated with sharp shapes. Anecdotally, characters from popular media may also reflect this process. Consider Laurel and Hardy, Asterix and Obelix or Bert and Ernie, in relation to the sound of their names and corresponding appearance, for example. Name-shape associations and the Bouba-Kiki phenomenon are clearly substantiated by this strong base of research.

This finding of shared perceptions in response to certain sounds is also consistent across dimensions of age and native tongue. Maurer, Pathman and Mondloch (2006) document observations of sound symbolism occurring in children as young as two and a half years. Equally, research conducted across multiple languages further demonstrates this phenomenon’s universality. Even the aforementioned critics of the literature, Styles and Gawne (2017), agree that the Bouba-Kiki effect can be observed throughout all languages of a facilitatory sound structure. From their multilingual meta-analysis, they suggested that future research can expect to find 84-94% of individuals giving the typical response if the names presented contain /b/, /m/, /l/, /o/, /u/ as the majority of rounded phonemes and /k/, /t/, /i/, /e/ as the majority of spikey phonemes. Other reports further document sound symbolism in German (Hilmer, 1914; Schuchdardt, 1897), French (Chastaing, 1958; Peterfalvi, 1970), Hungarian (Fónagy, 1963) Danish (Jesperson, 1918), Korean (Kim, 1977; Martin, 1962), Chinese (Karlgren, 1962; Lapolla, 1994), Japanese (Amanuma, 1974) and African languages (Samarin, 1967). The phenomenon is clearly ubiquitous.

Beyond these auditory-visual perceptual connections, however, research also demonstrates the incidence of cross-modal associations between sensory stimuli and more abstract concepts. In particular, there is a growing interest in examining sound symbolism in relation to eliciting perceptions of animate characteristics and personality traits. Research by Sidhu and Pexman (2015), for example, not only reported that people tend to assign perceptions of ‘maleness’ to angular shapes and perceptions of ‘femaleness’ to rounded shapes, but also that people seem to associate names containing sharp-sounding phonemes (/k/, /p/, /t/, /i/, /e/, /ε/ and /ʌ/) with traits such as determination and rigidity, and names containing round-sounding phonemes (/b/, /l/, /m/, /n/, /u/, /o/, /ɒ/) with traits such as friendliness. Another key experiment from Sidhu, Deschamps, Bourdage and Pexman (2019) extends this understanding at a further level of specificity. From examining the associations that participants made between presented names and adjectives, significant links were established between names of particular phonemic structures and certain personality dimensions of the HEXACO model of personality (Ashton, Lee, Perugini, Szarota, de Vries, Di Blas, Boies & De Raad, 2004). These associations were found between first-names containing sonorant phonemes (speech sounds produced with a continuous, uninterrupted airflow) and perceived emotionality, agreeableness and conscientiousness – while names containing voiceless-stop phonemes (consonants made with no audible sound except in the transition to or from another sound) were associated with high extraversion. Through an additional analysis of real-world first-names and corresponding personalities, it was confirmed that these results did not derive from genuine patterns occurring outside of the experiment – bolstering the validity of the notion that such observations indeed reflected the cross-modal link between sounds and personality traits, exclusively. Evidently, people do not only share similar perceptual links between simple sounds and shapes, but also between sounds and more complex ideas – including those relating to character.

Despite this significant development in our understanding of sound symbolism, the base of literature surrounding associations between names and personality traits remains narrow. Results indicative of this pattern have been reported in a Japanese analysis of fictional works – finding connections between the phonemic structures of character names and corresponding aspects of gender and heroism/villainy (Miyakoda & Oshita, 2019). However, the majority of other relevant studies tend to constitute commercial investigations of consumer attitudes towards brand names. Klink and Athaide (2012), for example, found that brand names pronounced with back vowels (vowels pronounced with the highest point of the tongue positioned towards the back of the mouth) were rated as more rugged, less sophisticated and less sincere than brand names consisting of front vowels. Similarly, other marketing research has emphasised the role of sound symbolism in using brand names to express product attribute information, varying from ketchup thickness to SUV size (Heath et al.,1990; Klink, 2000; Yorkston & Menon, 2004; Lowrey & Shrum, 2007). This research clearly offers some important insight into the cross-modal associations drawn from linguistic items, but still lack the reliability with which we might make inferences about such perceptions of names in a more interpersonal context. Beyond the existing evidence provided by the central research of Sidhu and Pexman (2015) and Sidhu et al. (2019), there is evidently a demand for further examination of the ways in which people process others’ names, whether this is determined by phonemic structure, and the perceptions that are formed in response. Even within these latter reports, which form the central basis of our current investigation, the researchers’ use of explicit self-report measures means that participants likely had greater awareness of the assessment, consequently increasing the risk of confounds from factors such as demand characteristics or personal associations with the names presented. Participants were, indeed, asked to focus solely on the name stimuli and ignore personal influences, though no direct measures were taken to control for this. As such, we aimed to pursue the same direction of investigation while employing a more implicit methodology in effort to eliminate such risks.

The present study therefore aims to expand current understanding by further exploring the relationship between the sounds of names and personality traits. Building on the findings of the centrally-relevant research by Sidhu et al. (2019), we tested for any connection between specific phonemic structures (names containing either sonorants or voiceless-stops) and trait agreeableness or disagreeableness, through use of the Implicit Association Test (Greenwald, McGhee & Schwartz, 1998). The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is a methodology that works to covertly measure the strength of association between two concepts by tasking participants with sorting stimuli from four categories using two response keys, each of which are assigned to two of four categories. It assumes that participants will be faster and more accurate at sorting stimuli when two associated concepts share the same response key. The participants of this study were therefore tasked with distinguishing between sharp-sounding names (consisting of voiceless-stop phonemes) and round-sounding names (consisting of sonorant phonemes), identifying agreeable either agreeable or disagreeable traits, as well as blocks involving both categorisation tasks, together. By comparing speed and accuracy in conditions where responses to sonorant names and agreeable traits were congruent in lateral positioning, with conditions in which this positioning was incongruent, our experiment aimed to assess whether any implicit associations can be found between phonemes and personality traits. Based on the limited literature available, we expected to find faster response times and higher accuracy under conditions of the IAT in which responses to agreeable traits and sonorant names shared the same lateral position – indicating, as previously suggested, a perceptual association between rounded-sounding names and agreeableness (Sidhu et al., 2019).

## Method
### Design
We employed a within-subjects and within-items design in order to compare response times and accuracy under conditions in which participants categorised adjectives as either agreeable or disagreeable traits, and names as either rounded-sounding (containing primarily sonorant phonemes) or sharp-sounding (containing primarily voiceless-stops). The independent variable was operationalised as the relative positioning of the the rounded-names category to the agreeable traits category (and the sharp-names category to disagreeable traits category) in each trial. This was either congruent or incongruent. Our dependent variables were the reaction times (secs) and accuracy (% correct) of these responses.

### Participants
A sample of 24 participants was recruited via word of mouth and online private messaging. Those invited took part in the study provided they had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, were able to understand the task and agreed to participate.

### Materials
The 36 adjective stimuli were selected by the researchers using Google’s English Dictionary, provided by Oxford Languages. 18 synonyms for agreeable and 18 synonyms for disagreeable were collected.
The 36 name stimuli were taken from Sidhu et al.’s (2019) study of cross-modal association between phonemes and personality traits. These researchers selected the names from the 2014 Alberta Services list of registered baby names and split them into two groups based on their phonemic structure. Rounded-sounding names were characterised by the sonorants /m/, /n/ and /l/, while sharp-sounding names contained the voiceless-stop phonemes /p/, /t/ and /k/, as these distinct groups of consonants have been shown to elicit opposing sound-symbolism associations in previous research (Köhler, 1929; Nielsen & Rendall, 2011, 2013).
The round and angular shapes, used as the category labels for name-allocation trials, were taken from an example presented in Sidhu et al.’s (2019) paper, demonstrating the typical stimuli capable of establishing the Bouba-Kiki effect (see Appendix A).

### Procedure
Prospective participants were first directed to a webpage of written documentation (using the online resource Qualtrics) that they could view using their mobile or computer device. This documentation outlined the purpose of the experiment, what participation would involve and their rights concerning to protection from harm, confidentiality and data withdrawal. If they provided their consent, the participants were then provided with information to educate them on the Bouba-Kiki effect (see Appendix B), as well as a table presenting all of the stimuli that would be displayed throughout the test (see Appendix C) – to prepare them for the experimental task. From Qualtrics, they were then directed to the online experiment (run by Pavlovia, using program files uploaded to GitLab).
The experiment, a form of the Implicit Association Test (Greenwald et al. 1998), consisted of five blocks of trials involving the categorisation of presented items. Items were presented in the centre of the screen, in random order, with the labelled categories shown as square buttons on either side of items, to the left and right. Participants allocated items by touching the buttons (if using mobile), or by pressing A and L on their keyboard (if using a computer). The A key would correspond to the category on the left while the L key would correspond to the category on the right. 18 items belonged to each category, within each block. The first block of trials, for all participants, involved pairing 36 names (each distinguished as containing either sonorant or voiceless-stop phonemes) with either the rounded or angular shapes of each category, on the basis of matching rounded-sounding names with the rounded shape, and sharp-sounding names with the angular shape category. The second block of trials then required participants to categorise 36 adjectives as either agreeable or disagreeable traits. The third block constituted the first of the experimental trials, involving the same categorisation of both the name and adjective stimuli presented in the previous blocks, in a mixed and random order. The fourth block involved the same practice task as block two of the experiment, with the positioning of the agreeable and disagreeable trait categories swapped, counterbalancing the side on which participants saw each category first. The fifth and final block then involved the same experimental task as block three, except the pairing of categories on each side of the screen was changed. Participants allocating rounded-sounding, sonorant names and agreeable traits to the left (and sharp-sounding, voiceless-stop names and disagreeable traits to the right) in block three then had to allocate sonorant names and disagreeable traits to the left (and voiceless-stop names and agreeable traits to the right) in block five – and vice-versa. Adjectives and adjective category labels were presented in blue, while names and name category labels were presented in green, in order to help participants maintain their understanding of the task. Participants could take breaks between blocks after all trials had been run, during which time instructions outlining the categories and responses for the next block were displayed. The experiment would continue when participants pressed the screen or spacebar. Upon completion of all blocks, participants were thanked for taking part and the experiment was ended.

### Data analysis
In order to examine an association between the concepts of name type (rounded vs. angular) and personality traits (agreeable vs. disagreeable), we performed a linear mixed model analysis with response time as the predicted value, and a logistic generalised linear mixed model with accuracy as the predicted value. These were performed using the statistical software R. The analyses had condition as a discrete predictor with six levels, using five contrasts. The first contrast was made between trials in which categories for rounded/sonorant names and agreeable traits shared the same lateral position and response, and trials in which this positioning and corresponding keypress was distinct. The next contrast was made between practice blocks involving the categorisation of either names or adjectives, individually, and experimental blocks involving the categorisation of both names and adjectives. Another contrast was made between blocks of name-categorisation and blocks of adjective-categorisation. The final contrast was made between adjective-categorisation blocks in which agreeable traits were allocated to the left, with disagreeable traits allocated to the right, and trials in which agreeable traits were allocated to the right, with disagreeable traits allocated to the left. Responses were excluded from analysis if they occurred less than 30ms or more than 3000ms after the item was presented, or achieved an error rate above 20%.


## Results
Participants took an average of 0.26 seconds longer when categorisation of sonorant names and disagreeable traits demanded the same lateral key response (mixed SD trials), compared to when responses to sonorant names and agreeable traits shared a response key (mixed SA trials). They were also less accurate in the former condition, with the odds of achieving a correct response equating to 72% of the latter. These differences were significant. They also spent a significant 0.15 seconds longer, on average, in the experimental conditions which involved the categorisation of items to two concepts in the same block (i.e. categorising names and adjectives at once, as in the mixed SA and mixed SD blocks), than in the practice conditions involving the categorisation of items to just one concept at a time (i.e. categorising either names or adjectives at once, as in the names block and adjectives blocks). Accuracy followed the same pattern, with the odds of a correct answer in experimental conditions being 63% of the odds for practice trials. Of the practice trials, participants were less accurate and took an average of 0.13 seconds longer when categorising names, compared to adjective-categorisation trials (adjectives AL and adjectives AR trials). The odds of correct responses in name trials were 44% of the odds for adjective trials. These differences were also significant. The lateral positioning of adjective categories, within the practice adjective-allocation blocks, did not significantly influence response speeds or accuracy.

## Discussion
The results of our experiment show that participants were faster and more accurate in practice trials, involving the allocation of either names or adjectives, than in experimental trials where both names and adjectives were categorised together in the same block. This is unsurprising, since the latter required the allocation of two sets of stimuli at once, while the former required the allocation of just one. The significant difference in accuracy and response time discovered between these conditions therefore likely reflects this distinction in cognitive load. Participants were also found to respond faster and more accurately in adjective-allocation conditions (identifying agreeable and disagreeable traits), compared to name-allocation trials in which items were each matched to a spikey or rounded shape. This may also be clearly explained by differing cognitive demand. While the literature has demonstrated that individuals associate the same names and shapes at highly consistent rates, along a basis of shared phonemic and geometric angularity (Ramachandran & Hubbard, 2001), the logic that determines this categorisation is arguably less clearly defined or familiar to participants than the connection existing between adjectives and their respective identity as agreeable or disagreeable traits. As such, performance in the former conditions likely demanded more consideration, equating to longer reactions and less certainty in responses. The accuracy at which participants performed during the name-shape allocation trials (81% correct), however, is particularly of note in that it provides significant substantiative evidence for the Bouba-Kiki effect – demonstrating that individuals are indeed capable of pairing items along a basis of similar phonemic and geometric angularity. The most interesting finding from our study, however, is the discovery that participants were significantly faster and more accurate at allocating items when categories for rounded-sounding names and agreeable traits (and sharp-sounding names and disagreeable traits) were congruent in lateral positioning and corresponding keypress. Along the logic of the IAT, this suggests that individuals implicitly associate words of sonorant phonemes with agreeableness, and words of voiceless-stop phonemes with disagreeableness. This supports the notion of cross-modal links between sounds and more abstract concepts of personality – specifically demonstrating consistent attributions between sonorant phonemes and agreeableness, and voiceless-stops and disagreeableness, which is consistent with the patterns identified by the existing literature (Sidhu et al., 2019).

Considering the implications of these findings, one could argue that this process has particular pertinence to a social context. It is already well-understood that individuals form impressions of others on the basis of displayed behaviour (Uleman, Blader & Todorov, 2005), facial appearance (Zebrowitz, 2017; Willis & Rodorov, 2006) and associated stereotypes (Holbrook, Fessler & Navarrete, 2016). However, our results further suggest that preconceptions about an acquaintance may also be influenced by the sound and phonemic structure of what they are called. This idea is particularly supported by the apparent extent to which the Implicit Association Test is reported to be capable of predicting behaviour. Greenwald and Farnham (2000), and Jordan, Spencer & Zanna (2002), for example, found that participant reactions to success and failure experiences could be effectively predicted by IAT-based measures of self-esteem. Similarly, McConnell and Liebold (2001) examined participant results on a racial-prejudice IAT, immediately following a brief interaction with a white experimenter and immediately prior to an interaction with a black experimenter. From ratings of these participant-experimenter interactions, it was found that IAT scores were significantly related to their observed behaviour. Such findings demonstrate clear support for the predictive validity of the test and offer marked substantiation for the idea that the associations established by our own use of the IAT hold marked relevance to real-life social attitudes and the consequent interactions that these incite.

However, while this examination of the relevant literature appears to support such inferences from our established sound-trait associations to broader social contexts, it is important to remember that associations identified by the IAT do not necessarily establish a pattern of direct attribution, but simply a tendency to link two concepts. From our specific study, we may not certainly conclude that individuals will anticipate agreeableness when encountering someone with a rounded-sounding name, or expect disagreeableness from someone of a sharp-sounding name, for example. We may only suggest, along the logic of the design, that a mental connection between these concepts exists. Furthermore, while there evidently exists a substantial base of literature supporting the IAT’s predictive validity, the credibility of some of these reports has also been debated. In criticism of the aforementioned study by McConnell and Liebold, for example, Olson and Fazio (2003) argue that, due to the structure of the experimental procedure, it is possible that completion of the IAT increased participant awareness of their racial attitudes and led to behavioural alterations within the subsequent experimenter interaction, or that their initial attitudes were influenced by the first interaction with the experimenter and consequently influenced performance on the test that followed.

Evidently, there is some debate surrounding the extent to which we can rely upon the findings of the IAT, in relation to their capacity for reflecting the possible behaviours that may be produced from the associations uncovered. While our findings show clear patterns of association between sounds and personality traits, with related literature suggesting that these patterns may indeed predict consequent behaviours, further investigation is clearly needed to clarify the extent to which we may make inferences about said findings to an interpersonal context. We argue that future research aiming to expand our current understanding of the relationship between language and perception, and the consequent influence of this on behaviour, would likely benefit from further study of the predictive ability of the IAT and applicability of our results, in context.

In addition to this discussion around the potential social and behavioural implications of the cross-modal associations established by the present study, our results also contribute to ongoing debate surrounding the way we currently understand language as a whole. Research such as that by de Saussure (1916) or Hockett (1963) has historically argued that language (outside of onomatopoeia) is arbitrary in nature, serving to facilitate communication through the functional allocation of certain sounds to certain concepts and stimuli in the environment. The word “car”, for example, has nothing in common with the object it represents, but continues to be used to identify it. Additionally, we often use multiple different words as names for the same subject. These observations lend to the suggestion that the sounds used to describe items are meaningless, in and of themselves. The notion of sound symbolism, however, challenges this. Research demonstrating shared associations between sounds and other stimuli indicates that individuals are influenced in their perceptions by language, itself. In this way, our own findings of implicit mental connections between sonorants and agreeableness, or voiceless-stops and disagreeableness, contribute relevantly to the literature by indicating that phonemes do indeed can carry connotations elicited purely by their sound and that language is not so arbitrarily assigned, as has been previously believed.

While our own findings and the broader context of sound-symbolism research clearly substantiate the process by which people are able to attain cross-modal perceptions from simple units of sound (e.g. Köhler, 1929; Ramchandran & Hubbard, 2001; Sidhu & Pexman, 2015; Sidhu et al., 2019), it is also important to note that the associations identified by this literature are abundant and diverse. There are sometimes similarities in the perceptions elicited by certain phonemes, but in other instances these are markedly distinct. For example, while Sidhu and Pexman (2015) and Miyakoda and Oshita (2019) both report a tendency to link the phoneme /m/ with ‘friendliness’ and ‘goodness’, respectively, the two studies also find different traits associated with the phoneme /b/. Sidhu and Pexman link /b/ with a friendly, easy-going personality, while Miyakoda and Oshita conversely report it to be linked with ‘badness’. Clearly, the way in which units of language are perceived, and consequently elicit associations with other concepts or sensory experiences, is very complex. There are many ways any one stimulus can be interpreted, despite there being regular consistencies in these interpretations across many individuals. As a result, while our own findings may demonstrate a lperceptual association between sonorants, voiceless stops and agreeable or disagreeable personality traits, it is clear that there is much more to be explored within this area of study if we are to achieve an encompassing understanding of ways certain sounds may influence individuals’ cognitions.

The phenomenon of sound symbolism is clearly a ubiquitous and important feature of human perception, though there exist significant facets of this topic that remain understudied. Research demonstrating cross-modal associations between sounds and shapes, such as the experiments by Köhler (1929), Ramchandran and Hubbard (2001), and our own study, clearly show a consistent effect. The scope of literature working to expand this understanding, however, remains limited. While our investigation clearly makes a pertinent contribution, producing findings consistent with those established by the relevant past research (e.g. Sidhu & Pexman, 2015; Sidhu et al., 2019), there remains much to be understood regarding the other types of associations and attributions that may exist between sounds and traits – as well as the extent to which the so-far identified associations may influence perceptions between people and social interactions. Examination of the existing literature, alongside our own discovery of sonorant-agreeable and voiceless-stop-disagreeable links, identifies clear suggestions about the role of language in the nature of human perception – though without further empirical exploration, it will remain uncertain whether the Owens, Lunas and Warrens of the world are indeed perceived as any more agreeable than the Victors, Katies and Erics, due to the mere structure and sound of their names.
